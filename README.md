# CALCULATOR - by PabloPG

## A calculator project to learn how to use event listeners

### Created with HTML, CSS & JS

#### What would I add or change in the future?

-Let the user type the numbers and operations using the keyboard and not clicking on the buttons.
-There are things that are working not as good as they should (If you click twice on x, per example, it will display the result of any number x 0).

I've prefered stop working on this project and keep learning the stuff I need, that's why it may feel unfinished.

That's all folks!
